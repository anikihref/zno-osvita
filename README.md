# zno-osvita
So it's mu first pet-project. I haven't done it yet, but I still working on it. In a few month I'll make it look better then original site [zno-osvita](https://zno.osvita.ua/).

# I'm sorry
I started learn git and how github is working recently. I swear I'll make my project and this hub look better in some period of time.
